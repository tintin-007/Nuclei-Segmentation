In this project, a deep learning based automated nuclei segmentation method is applied to four types of cancerous cells:
glioblastoma (GBM), log grade glioma (LGG), non small cell lung cancer (lung), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer (HNSC).

## Methodology

The methodology followed in this project can be mainly broken down into five phases:
image resizing, binary label production, patch extraction from the training set, data augmentation of the patches, and, lastly, nuclei segmentation.
